### Backstory

Two years ago I was 130lbs skinny and weak. During my senior year of highschool I battled with a lot of stress and anxiety. As a result, I didn't have an appetite and I  didn't eat. On top of that anything I managed to get down I would throw up (involuntary) in the morning. I hated how I felt and looked. 

A friend of mine reccomended that I start taking some form of martial arts. I joined a krav maga gym and instantly fell in love with the craft. Fighting killed two birds with one stone for me, I was dealing with my stress and anxiety and I was getting fit. My apetite slowly came back and my physique changed from skinny fat to lean muscle. After about 6 months I felt ready to start weight lifting. Looking back, fighting was a key step to my success in lifting and gaining. If I hadn't fixed my stress and appetite first I would have had a MUCH harder time with gaining weight.

### Your weight lifting program doesn't matter

A lot of people might disagree with me on this and while it is a bold claim, I stand by it. If you are new to weight lifting, are skinny, and don't have much muscle it really doesn't matter what weight lifting program you do. The only thing that matters is picking a program that you will **stick** to. Consistency and [progressive overload](https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/progressive-overload-the-concept-you-must-know-to-grow.html) are the two ingredients you need to get started (other than diet which I will discuss next).
