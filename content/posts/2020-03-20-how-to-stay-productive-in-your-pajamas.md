Now that the majority of the world is working from home we have an extra responsibility to stay focused and productive. While there are many upsides to working at home, no commute, comfy clothes, and flexible hours. There are also many downsides, lack of human interaction, lack of supervison, and distractions. The goal of this article is to give you some tips and tricks to try out if you aren't feeling as prodcutive as you were while at work or school.

### 1) Don't work in your bed

Your bed is a sacred place for sleeping (and other activities if you have a quarentine bae). While it may seem like a wonderful cozy and comfortable place to work usually you are much better off else where. Your sub conscious makes associations with everything you interact with. If you are sleeping in your bed everynight (hopefully) then you will associate your bed with sleep. Likewise, you probablty associate your desk with working/studying. For me, I always got most of my hard studying done in the library. Since that's not an option currently I work from my desk at home. Which happens to be in my room and extremley close to my bed. This is not an ideal situation, but that's life. 

### 2) Intense periods of focus followed by breaks

There are two types of breaks; one where you literally stop all work and do something else and one where you are still "working" but take a break from intense focus on a problem, what I like to call a mini break. 8 hours is a long time to be intensely focused on something and the majority of people rarely are. However, the problem I found was that I couldn't get *any* substanial periods of focus. I was "working" the entire time but at the end fo the day I didn't actually get much done.

What I found best for me was to split up my time into 90 minute intervals. I set a timer, all notifications are turned off (work notifications included), and the task at hand has my full attention until I complete it or the time is up. After that I spend 15-30 min checking emails, stretching, walking around, etc. Then it's time to set the timer again. I also highly suggest using noise cancelling headphones with this technique. 

I usually try to do 2 sessions in the morning and 2 after lunch depending on meetings or other commitments that day. The great thing about this technique is that it is easily adaptable to how you work. You may find it better to focus for 30 min then break for 5. The point is to have the majority of your time working be uninterrupted focus with breaks spread out in between those periods.

Lastly, you should take at least a 30 min lunch where all work and studying is paused. I find that walking outside in the sunshine is a great way to reset your brain and get you ready to conquer the afternoon.
