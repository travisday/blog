Now that the majority of the world is working from home we have an extra responsibility to stay focused and productive. While there are many upsides to working at home, no commute, comfy clothes, and flexible hours. There are also many downsides, lack of human interaction, lack of supervision, and more distractions. The goal of this article is to give you some tips and tricks to try out if you aren't feeling as productive as you were while at work or school.

### 1) Don't work in your bed

Your bed is a sacred place for sleeping (and other activities if you have a quarantine bae). While it may seem like a wonderful cozy and comfortable place to work usually you are much better off elsewhere. Your subconscious makes associations with everything you interact with. If you are sleeping in your bed every night (hopefully) then you will associate your bed with sleep. Likewise, you probably associate your desk with working/studying. For me, most of my hard studying was done in the library. Since that's not an option currently I work from my desk at home. Which happens to be in my room and extremely close to my bed and where I'm tempted to nap, play video games, or find any other excuse not to work. This is not an ideal situation, but hey that's life.

### 2) Move spots

Following point 1 if you still feel like you are getting distracted at your desk move around the house. If you have some reading to do, find a nice spot outside in the sunshine. I live with 4 other roommates and found that working at the dining room table with others makes me more accountable and I can get into a flow.

### 3) Intense periods of focus followed by breaks

There are two types of breaks; one where you literally stop all work and do something else and one where you are still "working" but take a break from intense focus on a problem, what I like to call a mini break. 8 hours is a long time to be intensely focused on something and the majority of people rarely are. However, the problem I found was that I couldn't getanysubstantial periods of focus. I was "working" the entire time but at the end of the day I didn't actually get much done.

What I found best for me was to split up my time into 90 minute intervals. I set a timer, all notifications are turned off (work notifications included), and the task at hand has my full attention until I complete it or the time is up. After that I spend 15-30 min checking emails, stretching, walking around, etc. Then it's time to set the timer again. I also highly suggest using noise cancelling headphones with this technique.

I usually try to do 2 sessions in the morning and 2 after lunch depending on meetings or other commitments that day. The great thing about this technique is that it is easily adaptable to how you work. You may find it better to focus for 30 min then break for 5. The point is to have the majority of your time working be uninterrupted focus with breaks spread out in between those periods.

Lastly, you should take at least a 30 min lunch where all work and studying is paused. It can be tempting to just work through lunch and end the day a little early, but if productivity is your goal your brain will be fatigued towards the end of the day lowering your work output. I find that walking outside in the sunshine is a great way to reset your brain and get you ready to conquer the afternoon.

### 4) Wake up right

Morning routines are very underrated and can make or break your day. I get it, It's difficult to set aside time in the morning for "extra" stuff. Usually we hit snooze a couple times then have the panic rush out the door barley having time to make a cup of coffee. Since we have to go no more than 10 feet to get to work now we can use some of that commute time to set ourselves up for the day.

There are many resources out there for theoptimalmorning routine, but my best advice is to do what YOU like to do (except sleep). Getting up is a lot easier if you have something to look forward to. My goal for the morning is to be working an hour after my alarm goes off. Now, I'm not gonna lie, I hit the snooze button more often than I'd like, but I feel a lot better when I don't and suck it up and get out of bed. To fill the next hour I like to start by making coffee. I then like to sit in the sun and drink my coffee, read the news, and play guitar. After that I do some form of meditation and/or yoga. After all that I feel ready to tackle anything.

### 5) Get good sleep

This is the MOST important tip I can give you. Getting good sleep will fix a lot of things in your life and as far as being productive goes, no amount of caffeine or stimulants will replace a good night's sleep. This section could be a whole article on it's own and hopefully I'll get to writing that article in a week or so. As for now, the two most important things are to make sure you get 7-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep and sleep at the right time. To sleep at the right time you have to listen toyourbody. Some people are night owls while others are early birds. I am somewhere in between the two. I feel best when I get to bed around 12 and am up around 8.

I hope you found some useful pieces in this article. Everyone is different so try new things and keep what works and throw out what doesn't. Thanks for reading till the end and hope you have a productive quarantine!
