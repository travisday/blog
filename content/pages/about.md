I am a Junior Computer Science major at the University of Southern California. Apart from computer science, I am fascinated with the intersection of technology and health. We are living an exciting time where we are pushing the limits of human performance, body optimization, and anti-aging. 

I also enjoy being outdoors, surfing, making music. To get a better idea of who I am feel free to follow me in instagram.
